//!
//! ***
//!
//! `concision` aims to be a complete machine-learning toolkit written in Rust. The framework
//! is designed to be performant, extensible, and easy to use while offering a wide range of
//! features for building and training machine learning models.
//!
//! The framework relies heavily on the [`ndarray`](https://docs.rs/ndarray) crate for its
//! n-dimensional arrays, which are essential for efficient data manipulation and mathematical
//! operations.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - `data`: Provides utilities for data loading, preprocessing, and augmentation.
//! - `derive`: Custom derive macros for automatic implementation of traits
//! - `init`: Enables various initialization strategies for model parameters.
//! - `macros`: Procedural macros for simplifying common tasks in machine learning.
//! - `neural`: A neural network module that includes layers, optimizers, and training
//!   utilities.
//!
//! ### _Extensions_
//!
//! The crate is integrated with several optional externcal crates that are commonly used in
//! Rust development; listed below are some of the most relevant of these _extensions_ as they
//! add additional functionality to the framework.
//!
//! - [`approx`](https://docs.rs/approx): Enables approximate equality checks for
//!   floating-point arithmetic, useful for testing and validation of model outputs.
//! - `json`: Enables JSON serialization and deserialization for models and data.
//! - [`rayon`](https://docs.rs/rayon): Enables parallel processing for data loading and
//!   training.
//! - [`serde`](https://serde.rs): Enables the `serde` crate for the serialization and
//!   deserialization of models and data.
//! - [`tracing`](https://docs.rs/tracing): Enables the `tracing` crate for structured logging
//!   and diagnostics.
//!
//! ## Roadmap
//!
//! - **DSL**: Create a pseudo-DSL for defining machine learning models and training processes.
//! - **GPU**: Support for GPU acceleration to speed up training and inference.
//! - **Interoperability**: Integrate with other libraries and frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch)
//! - **Visualization**: Utilities for visualizing model architectures and training progress
//! - **WASM**: Native support for WebAssembly enabling models to be run in web browsers.
