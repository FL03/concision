//! # Vector Space
//!
//! A vector space is defined to be a set V, whose elements are called vectors, on which are defined two operations,
//! called addition and multiplication by scalars (real numbers), subject to the ten axioms listed below.
//!
//! ## Axioms
//!
//! 1. Closure under addition
//! 2. Closure under scalar multiplication
//! 3. Commutativity of addition
//! 4. Associativity of addition
//! 5. Additive identity
//! 6. Additive inverse
//! 7. Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to vector addition
//! 8. Distributivity of scalar multiplication with respect to field addition
//! 9. Compatibility of scalar multiplication with field multiplication
//! 10. Identity element of scalar multiplication
